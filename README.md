## Ask-JGI

Ask-JGI is a helpdesk run by the Jean Golding Institute, more information can be found [here](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/supporting-your-research/data-science-support/).

This repository keeps a record of some of the code we've written for Ask-JGI queries. Code from an Ask-JGI query should be included in this repository if it will be useful for learning amongst the JGI team, or useful for future queries.
